# NumPy

Welcome to my **NumPy Learning Repository**
This repository contains my complete notes, code examples, and exercises as I learned and practiced **NumPy** the core library for numerical and scientific computing in Python.

## About the Project

NumPy (Numerical Python) is one of the most essential Python libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.  
Through this repository, I documented my learning journey from NumPy basics to advanced array manipulation and performance optimization techniques.

The learning is divided into three comprehensive notebooks:

1. **`12_Numpy_Fundamentals.ipynb`** – NumPy Basics  
   - Creating and manipulating arrays  
   - Array attributes and indexing  
   - Basic mathematical operations  
   - Broadcasting and vectorization  
   - Copy vs. view, reshaping arrays  

2. **`13_Advance_Numpy.ipynb`** – Advanced NumPy Concepts  
   - Advanced indexing and slicing  
   - Stacking and splitting arrays  
   - Random module and statistical operations  
   - Universal functions (ufuncs)  
   - Performance comparison with Python lists  

3. **`14_NumPy_Tricks.ipynb`** – Useful NumPy Tricks and Tips  
   - Handy shortcuts and one-liners  
   - Memory efficiency techniques  
   - Working with structured arrays  
   - Practical examples for data preprocessing  
   - Best practices for clean and optimized NumPy code
